## Welcome to Laser Focus Disc & Co.!

### This project was made with:

- React.js
- Node.js
- MySQL

### Frameworks and NPM packages I used to create the website:

- Gilder.js (Slider on the Homepage)
- TailWind.CSS (Styling)
- useForm (Contact Form)
- SocialIcons (social media icons)

The inspiration for this project was selling rare items to collectors. The LaserDisc is a discontinued movie format that halted production in 2005 due to the rise of DVD, and the only films that were made in this format range from the 70s up till the early 2000s.

This page serves as a love letter to times of the past and physical media.
